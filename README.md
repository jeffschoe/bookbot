# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

What BookBot does: 
-BookBot allows you to analyze books in .txt format. Books can be retrieved from a local diectory or downloaded from the web. 

How to use BookBot: 
-Specify if you want to analyze a local or web-based .txt file (book). 
-If local, specify the path to the .txt file. Books should be stored in the books/ directory. If one does not exist, it will be created for you.
-If web-based, provide the url to the .txt file. These files will be download and stored in the books/ directory.
-Web books should be Plain Text UTF-8
-Reports are stored in the reports/ directory. If a reports/ directory does not exist, it will be created for you.
